Visually, it has a very simple interface for the users to use the application easily and also to understand without major difficulties. The hashtag `#SocialDistancing`, which is also the title of the application, is shown above the application to persuade users to participate in the campaign.

### Algorithm

After the user submits the HTML form, the `Person` objects are created, and the animation starts. Then for each iteration, the each `Person` will be moved and detect whether there was a collision. If collided with an infected, the `Person` becomes infected.
